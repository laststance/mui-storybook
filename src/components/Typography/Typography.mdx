# Typography

Text display

## Overview

The MUI Typography component applies consistent text styles. It provides various variants based on Material Design's typography scale, including headings (h1-h6), body text (body1, body2), subtitles, and captions. By working with themes, it uniformly manages font family, size, weight, line height, and more, achieving accessible and readable text display.

## Primary Demo

<Primary />

## Interactive Controls

Use the controls below to modify properties:

<Controls />


## All Variants

<Stories />

## Usage Example

```tsx
import Typography from '@mui/material/Typography'

function Article() {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="h1" gutterBottom>
        Main Heading
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h2" gutterBottom>
        Section Heading
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        This is a paragraph of body text. It uses the body1 variant
        which is suitable for most text content.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="caption" color="text.secondary">
        This is caption text for additional information
      </Typography>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Accessibility

- Generates semantic HTML elements using the `variant` property
- Maintains proper hierarchy for heading levels (h1-h6)
- Controls visual style and HTML elements independently using the `component` property
- Uses colors with sufficient contrast ratios
- Enables screen readers to understand document structure
