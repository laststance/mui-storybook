# Stepper

Step-based navigation

## Overview

The MUI Stepper component visually displays the progress of a process consisting of multiple steps. It clearly presents multi-stage tasks to users, such as form input, checkout processes, and setup wizards. It supports various styles and patterns including horizontal or vertical layouts, alternative label placement, and error state display.

## Usage Example

```tsx
import Stepper from '@mui/material/Stepper'
import Step from '@mui/material/Step'
import StepLabel from '@mui/material/StepLabel'
import { useState } from 'react'

const steps = ['Select campaign', 'Create ad group', 'Create ad']

function SetupWizard() {
  const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = useState(0)

  return (
    <Stepper activeStep={activeStep}>
      {steps.map((label) => (
        <Step key={label}>
          <StepLabel>{label}</StepLabel>
        </Step>
      ))}
    </Stepper>
  )
}
```

## Accessibility
