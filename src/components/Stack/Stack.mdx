# Stack

One-dimensional layout component

## Overview

The MUI Stack component is a one-dimensional layout component for arranging child elements vertically or horizontally. Based on Flexbox, it allows you to concisely configure element spacing, direction, dividers, and more. It supports responsive breakpoints, enabling layout changes based on screen size. It can be utilized in various scenarios including forms, button groups, and lists.

## Primary Demo

## Interactive Controls

## All Variants

## Usage Example

```tsx
import Stack from '@mui/material/Stack'
import Button from '@mui/material/Button'
import Divider from '@mui/material/Divider'

function ButtonGroup() {
  return (
    <Stack
      direction="row"
      spacing={2}
      divider={<Divider orientation="vertical" flexItem />}
    >
      <Button>Button 1</Button>
      <Button>Button 2</Button>
      <Button>Button 3</Button>
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

## Accessibility

- Maintains semantic HTML structure
- `direction` and `spacing` affect only layout and do not change DOM order
- Preserves logical content order even with responsive layout changes
- Screen readers announce content in natural order
