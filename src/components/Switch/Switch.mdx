# Switch

Toggle switch

## Overview

The MUI Switch component is a toggle switch for switching between two states: on and off. While it has similar functionality to a checkbox, it provides a more mobile-friendly and visually clear UI. It is suitable for toggle operations that take effect immediately, such as turning settings on/off and enabling/disabling features. Size, color, and label placement can be customized.

## Primary Demo

## Interactive Controls

## Usage Example

```tsx
import Switch from '@mui/material/Switch'
import FormControlLabel from '@mui/material/FormControlLabel'
import { useState } from 'react'

function SettingsToggle() {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false)

  return (
    <FormControlLabel
      control={
        <Switch
          checked={checked}
          onChange={(e) => setChecked(e.target.checked)}
        />
      }
      label="Enable notifications"
    />
  )
}
```

## Accessibility

- Has the checkbox role (`role="checkbox"`)
- Supports keyboard operations (Space, Enter)
- Indicates state using the `aria-checked` attribute
- Clearly associates with labels when combined with FormControlLabel
- Screen readers properly announce state changes
